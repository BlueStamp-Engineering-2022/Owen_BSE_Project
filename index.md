# Three Joint Robotic Arm
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was creating the arm itself, as well as implementing the code to allow controlling it with either a controller (wired) or a phone (bluetooth).  The process went pretty smoothly overall, with only a few bumps when I would attach some parts wrong, which took long times to fix since the nuts were very hard to work with.  One of the bigger problems was the power draw of the arm, and sometimes the 5 volts from the usb cable was not enough, and it would stop working at random times.  The fix for this was to simply add an external power supply in the form of a 9 volt battery.

# Starter Project
  My starter project was a customizeable arduino, where I chose a potentiometer for my input and a motor as my output.  The parts I used were a Arduino UNO, Protoshield V6, Motor driver, motor, potentiometer, and many jumper cables.  I enjoyed learning how to solder as well as building circuits, and my biggest problem was with the motor driver, where I had to troubleshoot for a while before I could get it to work.
